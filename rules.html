        <h1>Game Rules</h1>
        <p>In the game Taboo, players on a team take turns describing a word (the "guess word") to their teammates without using any of the related "taboo" words listed on the card, or any parts of those words, gestures, sound effects, or "sounds like" clues.</p>
        <p>Someone from the other team will also see the card to make sure the taboo word is not used. You have one minute to guess as many words as you can. Don't forget to keep track of points.</p>
