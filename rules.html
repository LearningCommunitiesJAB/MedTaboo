        <h2>Read Out Loud</h2>
        <p>In the game Taboo, players on a team take turns describing a word (the "guess word") to their teammates without using any of the related "taboo" words listed on the card, or any parts of those words, gestures, sound effects, or "sounds like" clues.</p>
        <p>Someone from the other team will also see the card to make sure the taboo word is not used. You have one minute to guess as many words as you can. When the time is up, the it's the other team's turn. Play as many rounds as you want, or until you run out of cards.</p>
        <p>When your team correctly guesses a word, click 'Correct'. </p>
        <p>If you accidentally say a Taboo word, click 'Taboo!'.</p> 
        <p>If you are just STUCK, just click 'Pass', but you only get one per round.</p>
